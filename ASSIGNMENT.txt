   -- The data consists of two of four (4) originals: the 746 data and the Impens data. (The 1625 data and the Schilling data are not included here)
   

3. Number of instances
   - 746 data: 746 
   - Impens data: 947 


4. Attributes

   There are 20 allowed letters in the 8 character string (the allowed alphabet): 'ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV'
   These represent amino acids.
   The cleavage label has only two possible values: -1 and +1.


5. Number of attributes

   There are only two attributes: a 8 letter string (octamer) and a label that tells whether this string represents a site in a peptide (or protein) where the HIV-1 protease cleaves it (+1 if yes, -1 if no). 
   The 8 letter string can also be viewed as 8 independent attributes. It is common to map the 8 letters to an orthogonal binary representation; a 8 by 20 matrix (8 letters, 20 amino acids) that is transformed into a 160-dimensional vector (See more in Methods in the reference paper at the end, also attached)  
   

6. Class distributions

   - 746 data: 402 cleaved, 344 non-cleaved
   - Impens data: 149 cleaved, 798 non-cleaved

       - Discusses the characteristics of the four data sets.
       - It is shown that a linear SVM with standard orthogonal encoding is the best
         predictor when tested across data sets. The AUC (Area Under the [ROC] Curve)
         value is 0.833 when using the 746 data as training set and the Impens data as the Test data. 

8. Your task
-Use your favorite SVM program (examples include but are not limited to: fitcsvm in MATLAB, SVM in e1071 package in R, LibSVM https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ that is available through many interfaces such as Matlab, R, Python, CUDA, C# etc and so on) to train on the 746 data and test on the Impens data. 
-Try different kernel functions (including the default dot product / linear SVM) provided in those programs and compare the ROC curves (sensitivity versus 1-specificity) and the corresponding AUC values.  Many programs plot the curves and calculate the AUC values for you. For nonlinear kernels with parameters, please use cross validation to optimize their values. 

OR
You can also try your favorite machine learning programs to meet or beat the original paper, that is, AUC=0.833.  (You are not graded based on the performance alone). 


What to turn in: A zipped folder containing
- A PDF file briefly documenting the methods, the ROC curves using different kernels and their AUC values, and what might be learned there.
